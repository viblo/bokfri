# Bokfri Modernization Backlog

This file tracks only modernization work that is still incomplete.

Completed work belongs in `CHANGELOG.md` and git history, not here.

## Current Snapshot

| Area | Current state |
|------|---------------|
| Java target | 21 |
| Tests | JUnit 5 + integration tests in place |
| Logging | SLF4J + Logback in place |
| Build tooling | Checkstyle, SpotBugs, JaCoCo, and CI are configured |
| Date/time migration | `Calendar` and `SimpleDateFormat` are gone; legacy `Date` boundaries remain |
| Persistence | Still based on Java serialization stored in HSQLDB `OBJECT` columns |

## Remaining Work

### 1. Finish Date/Time Modernization

Status: partially complete

Current repo state:
- `java.util.Calendar` usage has been eliminated from production code
- `SimpleDateFormat` usage has been eliminated from production code
- production `new Date()` runtime calls have been eliminated
- core date math/month helpers and focused voucher/invoice tests now prefer `LocalDate`
- more payment, credit-note, and periodic-invoice calculations now compare `LocalDate` values directly
- more revenue and report-period printers now use `LocalDate` month boundaries and comparisons directly
- more stock and inventory-related period filters now compare `LocalDate` values directly
- more accounting-year and report-setup flows now keep year boundaries as `LocalDate` until legacy UI/report APIs require `Date`
- more payment, inventory, and periodic-invoice panels now read and write `LocalDate` values directly from date choosers where supported
- more company and domain aggregate helpers now evaluate monthly membership against `LocalDate` values directly
- more product pricing, inpayment lookup, and main-book calculations now compare `LocalDate` values directly and bridge back to `Date` only for legacy return types
- more periodic-invoice generation and pending-invoice flows now keep schedule boundaries and next-invoice calculations as `LocalDate` values internally
- more invoice due-date table and sales print flows now read `LocalDate`/`LocalDate` due dates directly and only convert to `Date` at Jasper/table boundaries
- more list, journal, and debt printers now format `LocalDate` values directly and only bridge to `Date` for `DateFormat`-based rendering
- more import flows now parse incoming dates into `LocalDate` values before handing them to bookkeeping models and vouchers
- more in- and out-delivery flows now expose `LocalDate` directly in domain objects and keep table, panel, math, and list-printer paths on local dates until display boundaries
- more order, tender, purchase-order, and inventory report/import paths now use `LocalDate` accessors directly and bridge to `Date` only at XML or Jasper boundaries
- more payment journal, reminder, main-book, and transaction-cleanup flows now read local dates directly and only bridge to `Date` where report rendering still requires it
- more supplier-payment export flows now consume `LocalDate` values directly from payment models and only bridge back to `Date` when persisting config values
- more supplier-payment file-export posts now take `LocalDate` values from application models and only bridge to `Date` at the LB transfer file boundary
- more Excel export helpers now accept `LocalDate` values directly so voucher exports no longer detour through deprecated `Date` accessors before formatting
- more app dialogs now expose `LocalDate` values directly where callers immediately convert legacy `Date` values back to local dates for business logic
- more report dialogs now expose `LocalDate` directly for single-date flows and read local date ranges directly from chooser widgets in list dialogs
- legacy `Date` imports and bridge methods still remain at Swing, JasperReports, import/export, and persistence boundaries

Remaining tasks:
- Replace remaining `Date`-based APIs with `java.time` types where practical
- Remove or isolate deprecated bridge methods that still exist only for legacy callers
- Re-evaluate whether GUI date widgets can move fully to `java.time` without `Date` adapters

Done when:
- production code no longer depends on `Calendar`
- legacy `Date` usage is either removed or clearly constrained to unavoidable framework boundaries

### 2. Replace Serialization-Based Persistence

Status: not started

Current repo state:
- `46` production classes still implement `Serializable`
- storage is still built around serialized objects in HSQLDB
- HSQLDB is still `1.8.0.10`

Remaining tasks:
- Decide the target persistence strategy
  - normalized SQL schema
  - JSON/text document storage
  - another transitional approach on newer HSQLDB
- Design a migration path from existing user databases
- Build a migration tool that can read old serialized-object data and write the new format
- Incrementally remove `Serializable` from domain and backup models once the storage layer no longer depends on it
- Keep backup/restore working across the migration

Done when:
- new persistence format is implemented
- existing user data can be migrated safely
- domain model evolution no longer depends on Java serialization compatibility

### 3. Replace or Remove Obsolete Dependencies

Status: not started

Current repo state:
- `javax.mail` still present in `pom.xml` and referenced from mail/report code
- `jxl` still powers Excel import/export code
- `com.lowagie:itext` 4.2.2 is still used
- IntelliJ GUI Designer runtime/plugin is still required
- `javax.help:javahelp` is still present and actively referenced
- Spring dependencies remain in `pom.xml`, but there are `0` `org.springframework` references in `src/main/java`
- there are `111` IntelliJ `.form` files under `src/main`

Remaining tasks:
- Replace `javax.mail` with `jakarta.mail`
- Replace `jxl` with Apache POI or another maintained Excel library
- Replace `itext` 4.x with a maintained alternative such as OpenPDF if licensing/functionality fit
- Decide whether to keep or eliminate IntelliJ GUI Designer as a build dependency
- Replace or remove JavaHelp
- Remove unused Spring dependencies after confirming nothing depends on them indirectly

Done when:
- obsolete libraries are removed from `pom.xml`
- code paths using them have been migrated and verified

### 4. Tighten Build and Quality Gates

Status: partially complete

Current repo state:
- Checkstyle is configured, but `failOnViolation` is disabled
- SpotBugs is configured, but `failOnError` is disabled
- JaCoCo reports are generated
- PR CI runs `mvn clean install` on Linux, Windows, and macOS
- Linux CI runs Checkstyle as `continue-on-error`
- CI does not currently enforce SpotBugs or a coverage threshold

Remaining tasks:
- Reduce the existing Checkstyle baseline until violations can fail the build
- Reduce the SpotBugs baseline until issues can fail the build
- Decide whether to enforce a minimum coverage threshold
- Add any missing CI checks needed to make tooling enforcement consistent

Done when:
- style and static analysis checks can block regressions in CI
- coverage policy is explicit and enforced if desired

### 5. Optional API Cleanup After Core Modernization

Status: partially complete

Current repo state:
- `245` `return null` sites remain in production code
- many of the remaining sites are GUI, table-model, print, importer, or framework-boundary methods

Remaining tasks:
- Review remaining `return null` sites and separate intentional framework contracts from avoidable legacy API design
- Introduce `Optional<T>` only where it improves correctness and API clarity
- Avoid forcing `Optional` into Swing/table-model patterns where `null` is part of the expected contract

Done when:
- remaining `null` returns are either removed or intentionally documented by category

## Suggested Order

1. Finish the remaining date/time cleanup
2. Remove clearly unused dependencies such as Spring, if confirmed safe
3. Tackle library migrations with the smallest blast radius first (`javax.mail`, `jxl`, `javahelp`)
4. Decide the persistence migration strategy before changing storage-related models
5. Tighten CI quality gates after the dependency and persistence work stops moving the baseline

## Out of Scope for This File

These may be worthwhile, but they are broader architecture work rather than backlog items for the current modernization pass:

- breaking up `SSDB.java`
- replacing Swing with another UI framework
- introducing dependency injection across the app
- switching build tools
- adopting JPMS
